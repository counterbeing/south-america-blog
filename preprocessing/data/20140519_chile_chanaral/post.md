I started the ride south with the intention of doing some camping on the coast for a night or two, and was really looking forward to it. The day moved along fairly quickly, and I made a few stops to do some errands in the first moderately sized town I came to.

When I finally made it to the coast and saw the ocean again, it didn't look like the ocean I had just left. It felt so familiar. Cold, jagged and rocky. The smell and weight of the air was familiar too. I could breathe deeply, and really feel the difference between the air at the coast and the air way up high in La Paz. It made me think of the California coast, and how much I missed it. Which then made me think about missing my friends, and how soon I would be going home.

I was moving along down the road daydreaming about what it would be like to be back in San Francico, and calculating how many hours it would be to La Sarena (where the first potential motorcycle buyer was). Then it came, a sudden flutter of power. Not an immediate complete loss, but it felt like I was running out of gas. I flipped the pedcock remembering getting gas about thirty minutes prior. There was no way I was out of gas. I kept the bike on the road thinking perhaps I had some water in the line somehow, and I would just burn through it. But no, it didn't stop, and the power never came back. I mananged to keep it going for just a moment on the side of the road, but then nothing. 

Immediately my mind went to a gas issue. I found that there was gas as far as the float bowl. So, if there were something wrong with fuel delivery, it was inside of the carburator. Opening up the carb, wasn't something I wanted to do on the side of the road. 

I looked around. I was on mars. It really looked like mars. Red, iron enriched ground, with rocks everywhere. I imagined being out there alone with no possibility of other humans. Then I looked back down the road to see some vehicles off in the distance. I just stood there for a bit, deciding to give me some time to think it through. I couldn't have been there for ten minutes before two guys pulled over to ask me what was up. They looked at things with me, and I explained what I believed the problem to be, to the best of my ability. In the end, after a bit of fiddling they offered to throw my bike in back and take me to the next town.

I accepted, gratefully, and he drove me directly to his brother's house. We showed up, and I saw that his brother was indeed a mechanic. You can tell a mechanic's house by the have disassembled cars, and auto parts strewn about. It may not have been the ideal setup, but it beat the heck out of my time on mars, and it was a good enough space to take a carb apart. Over the next few days, I disassembled almost everything on the bike, aside from the portions of the motor that would require me to drain fluids. Cleaned out the carb, traced electrical wires, took the head cap off and watched cams operating valves, disabled the California emissions system... Nothing.

Throughout this time, Jorge and his family took care of me. The first day I was surprised when they insisted I come inside for lunch. I didn't want to be a burden to them. They were already being so nice, and allowing me to work on my motorcycle there. Jorge was always there to offer a hand, a tool, or a word of advice. Their son was always running around tinkering with something. Ususally he was taking apart some part of his quad, only to reassmble it and put it back on. At 9 years old, he's and amazing little guy. He always want's to help and giggle. I even got my hair cut by the family barber.   

Finally, I gave up on the motorcycle. It appeared that we needed to go deeper, into parts of the motorcycle I had never seen. Here, with no access to parts, and without a real workspace was not the place to do this. In a final act of selfless awesomeness, Jorge helped coordinate renting a truck, loading the bike, driving two hours south to a larger town, dropping by bike at a proper shop, and helping me to find a hotel. This man is an angel. It makes me feel incredibly guilty not knowing how to possibly repay these people for all of their kindness.
