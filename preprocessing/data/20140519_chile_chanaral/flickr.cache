His father is getting his head buzzed. As soon as dad (Jorge) is done with his haircut, he tells his son to sit down because he's about to get his hair cut as well. The child pouts for a moment, but then gets in the chair. After that was done, they joked that I should sit down... and so I did.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5516/14232112812_705c64e25b_c.jpg" alt="Family in Chañaral"><figcaption>Here's the family that's helping with storing, and working on my motorcycle. They've also been feeding me! Here's dinner. You just grab a loaf of bread and make yourself a little sandwich.

I only point it out because I've never opened it up to see it like that before.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5278/14047747658_4f95d9e1f4_c.jpg" alt="Downtown Chañaral"><figcaption>Here's the big city.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2906/14223350232_b233cd8cd3_c.jpg" alt="Broke Down KLR"><figcaption>These two guys were cool enough to stop and try to help.
