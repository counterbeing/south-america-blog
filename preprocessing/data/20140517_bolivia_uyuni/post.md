### I don't know what to say about the town

I arrived, dropped off my bags, and tensioned my chain. I grabbed lunch and then I took off for the Salar (the salt flats).

There's not a whole lot going on in the town. It was bigger than I expected based on descriptions, but it still doesn't have much. I had the worst burger of my life. It's quite cold up here at altitude as well.

But, the salt flat, is **incredible** and made it all worth while.
