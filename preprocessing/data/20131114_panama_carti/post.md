### A Three Hour Tour

Carti wasn't for the night, just to get the bikes on the [stahlratte](http://www.stahlratte.de/). That took a few hours, and turned out to be quite fun. Afterwards we headed off to a [Kuna](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuna_people) island to spend the night. The whole evening was pretty ridiculous. It was clear that the beds we were sleeing in belonged to someone else, and they just vacated them to sell them to us for the evening. But, being the only place to stay in the middle of the ocean, we all gladly stayed.

The islands the kuna live on are funny little sand bars, not even a meter above the ocean at their highest point, but somehow, they've been there for ages. Simply incredible.
