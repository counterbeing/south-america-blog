Just a quick pop off on the way down the road. It's adorable, but I don't know what I would do if I were staying here for very long. It was nice to walk around.

I had a funny gringo out of place experience, which are always somewhat welcome. I walked into a tiny restaurant, and everyone, I mean everyone, stopped talking and looked at me for a solid ten seconds. I know that doesn't sound like a long time, but it was. Anyway, I sat down, and people began talking again. I had a nice meal of soup, chicken, french fries, rice, and some freshly made strawberry juice. I expected to be gringo taxed, but was delighted to be charged the eqivalent of $2. I tipped them about fifty cents, and they tried to give it back to me thinking I had made a mistake. That's always a pleasant surprise.
