The same little man still runs the joint. Behind the bar here, is his immense record collection. Very cool. He serves two kinds of beer, I'm not sure that he sells anything else.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7359/12445035045_2dd98085ac_c.jpg" alt="Popayan Center Square"><figcaption>A cute little park in the middle of the old town. </figcaption></figure><figure><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7355/12445519134_712466562d_c.jpg" alt="Popayan Center Square"><figcaption>Seems I missed the church in this shot, oh well, I've seen  lot of them at this point.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3821/12445524104_3e45de0551_c.jpg" alt="White Colonial Buildings"><figcaption>As you can see, the white faced colonial buildings roll on and on.
