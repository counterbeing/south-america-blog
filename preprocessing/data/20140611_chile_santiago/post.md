I searched high and low to find a buyer, and instead found myself with a cold. The weather had been rough up in the mountains on the road to Mendoza, the logical next stop if my trip was to go on. I was pretty ready to end things at this point, if I found a suitable buyer. I did not.

It's very difficult to import things into Chile. I've heard legends of a free trade zone in the North and in the South, but I'm not entirely sure what good that would do me. Someone offered the alternative of buying the bike for parts, but that would require lying to the police about my bike being stolen, and I didn't like the idea of that.

There were a couple of nights of partying, a lot of pizzas, and a lot of tea. Eventually I came around to spending the extre $300 on a new stock chain and sprockets that I needed terribly. I have to say, I've never felt better about the condiiton of the bike. I know it so well, and it feels just right to me right now.
