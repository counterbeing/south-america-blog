This was a quick stop on my way to Buenos Aires. I can't really recommend it, but I also know I didn't see anything there was to see. The surrounding land, is flat, and does not provide very interesting riding. The only thing that kept me awake was a gusty side wind, but I can't say I apprecaited that very much.
