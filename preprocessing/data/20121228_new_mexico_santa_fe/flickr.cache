On a motorcycle that's cold. Anyway, Sheila and Fred immediately put me in front of the fire with a glass of Scotch. A good moment.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5497/11262480795_cc5daee42f_c.jpg" alt="Sheila"><figcaption>I'm really sorry I don't have a better photo.

I threw a ball for him and we kept walking. He didn't show up immediately so I went looking for him. I thought he was just stuck so I took a photo, but I soon found out he had impaled himself on a broken branch. We went straight to the vet from here. I'll spare you the other photos.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5477/11262582233_00e1ecda45_c.jpg" alt="Fred and Sophie"><figcaption>Nap time.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5498/11262608503_f1a460a5a2_c.jpg" alt="Rio"><figcaption>Black as night.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2827/11262571634_3c6068eda4_c.jpg" alt="Safety Glasses"><figcaption>Safety glasses are cool.
