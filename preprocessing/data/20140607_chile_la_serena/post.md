This was a one-nighter, just because I really wanted to keep moving quickly after the valve debacle. I found [a nice hostel](http://www.hostalelarbol.com/) to hang out at. Ate dinner, had a nap. Just when I thought nothing excitng was going to happen, which was perfect for a tired man, Jorge came and picked me up.

Jorge is a guy I met on the internet, because he had been considering buying my motorcycle. Anyway, Jorge showed me a great time. I went to meet his family, and then went out to a birthday thing of one of his friends. I ended up out later than I wanted to be, but I didn't regret it.
