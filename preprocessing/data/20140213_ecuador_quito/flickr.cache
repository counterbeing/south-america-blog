I see a lot of people with big guns here, but for some reason these guys seemed sort of intent. And since they walked past me i could take a photo without them noticing. I don't generally like to stick a camera in the face of people with guns. </figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7326/12506151455_a143465e54_c.jpg" alt="Cute Street"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7411/12506632224_b51ff0c3fc_c.jpg" alt="Big Church Quito"><figcaption>I don't recall the name of it.
