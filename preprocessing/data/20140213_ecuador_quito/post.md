I really like quito in some ways, and not in others. For example, it's surrounded by gigantic mountains, on the flip side, the air is thin and polluted. The people tend to be friendly, but they seem afraid of interaction on some levels (particularly when walking alone, I think they think I'm going to rob them or something). 

I'm still here while writing this, so I might just update it.
