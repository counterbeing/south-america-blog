The ride to Valparaiso was another unexpected adventure. It all started getting gas. I was a bit late on the start, which I knew would lead me into colder temperatures in the evening, but I wasn't particularly concerned.

The day ended safely, but full of embarrassment. I'm going to pull the, "it's because I had three hours of sleep", card. 

## The Wallet
I pulled up to the first tollbooth about an hour after departure. As I rolled up I reached for a wallet that wasn't in its proper place. I immediately realized I must have left it at the gas station somehow. Most likely I had just set it in my lap, and just rode away. I pulled off to the side. I started going through all of my things, already having lost hope, knowing there's one place and one place only I put my wallet, and it wasn't there.

A bus driver signaled at me, I explained the situation, and he gave me the money for the toll booth and told me where the next ATM was (fortunately, I still had my backup ATM card).

The next hour I still hadn't forgiven myself, and wouldn't give myself permission to relax until I had money again. I was in the middle of a long toll road without many stops. I only hoped I would arrive at the next ATM, before coming to the the next toll-booth. This soon turned into a find-the-ATM mini adventure.

Eventually I arrived, and the ATM gave me the money, and I was relieved, still mad, but relieved. I told myself "good, the systems I have in place kept this from being a really bad thing". Time for some cookies. I'm buying cookies, and pull out my phone, and find my wallet behind it, in the wrong pocket. I felt like such an ass.


## The Weakest Link

I was moving along down a nice stretch of road, feeling generally good about having found my wallet, but knowing also that I wasn't going to make it during daylight hours. I hit a bump. A strange bump that didn't make any sense, it didn't make any sense, because I didn't see a rock or anything, and I dodged it with my front tire, but not my rear. Very odd. 

Five minutes later I hit another mystery bump, and became concerned. In the amount of time it took me to curse a couple of times, I felt it again, and again. Was my engine okay? Was that new valve holding up? And then it stopped. My engine purred along like nothing was wrong, and I knew instantly my chain had flown off the back. After a few more choice words, I drifted over to the side of the road to come to a safe stop.

I gave myself a moment to simmer, hopped off the bike, and started walking back. If I had any chance of getting going again, it was that chain in the road a quarter mile back. I got to the chain just in time to watch two semi-trailer trucks run over it... And I knew they weren't the first. But, I picked it up, and it looked relatively undamaged.

I started putting the pieces together back at the bike, and luckily I had everything I needed, just a spare link I'd been carrying with me since San Francisco. Good thinking. A few guys that work on keeping the highway safe, stopped to offer a hand and file a report. Super nice guys. And then I was off. I rode carefully, and slowly for the rest of the night, and made it to a hostel at about 9 PM.
