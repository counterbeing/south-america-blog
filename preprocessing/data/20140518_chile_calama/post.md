### Preparation Ache

I left as early as I could, but before I could leave I had to go out in literally (and I do mean literally) freezing temperatures to attempt to replace a light bulb that I had shaken out on the way to the salar. It turned out my spare bulb wasn't working and so I had to steal my high beam for a low beam. I wasn't entirely pleased with this solution, but I knew that if I ended up caught in the dark I would rather have low beams. But the thing that really set my departure time was the immigration office. They weren't due to open until 9 and decided not to open until 9:30. If you're not travling by bus into Chile, it's a good idea to get an exit stamp in Uyuni before leaving Bolivia. The trick is that the immigration office at the border isn't always manned.

Finally, I got out of there. When I arrived at the gas station I noticed someone was filling gas cans, which brought the question bubbling up to the front of my mind: how far to the next gas station? Really far, as it turned out. So, I asked if they had anything I could carry some extra gas in. As it turned out they did. A couple of 2-liter water bottles. It was better than nothing, and I cleaned them out, and filled them up. I did some quick math to determine, that even on my worst mileage days I should hit reserve and maybe go a bit beyond. Then tied them on as best I could as I didn't want to put them inside my luggage with things I cared about. 

I rode on for about an hour, and then thought, I've probably got enough room in my gas tank now to put one of those bottles in and pull it off the bike. One of the bottles was missing. I wasn't too excited about that. I dumped the other bottle in and mulled it over. I opted to press on, thinking that if I didn't make it, I would at least be damn close to town, and that losing two hours could actually be dangerous. I had a mountain pass to make it through before dark. Temperatures would be back down to freezing if I didn't scrub some altitude.

### The Border

When it comes to border officials, there's really not much you can do. You're somewhat out of control. I arrived to find two other cars waiting for the officials to come and let them in. But, it didn't happen. We waited there at the border for four hours. All the while, dark was approaching, and I could feel the cold coming on. Finally they came out and started letting people through. They went through all of my bags, and checked me into the country. 

After dealing with that, I tried to get on as quickly as possible to use the remaining light. The remaining light wasn't of much use heading down a corrugated dirt road with a dusty visor, and with the sun in my eyes. As it turns out, riding off into the sunset is a bit overrated. 

The light faded and I headed higher up into the mountains. I was feeling somewhat bitter at the border officals for keeping me there for so long. It really felt like their negligence was putting me in an unecessarily risky situation. 

Being on a rough dirt road, it seemed to me that I could very well shake out the only remaining light bulb that was guiding me. I recalled there being three other vehicles behind me, so as long as one of them was willing and able to stop in the event of an emergency, I should be fine. It wasn't as if there were somewhere on the way they could be going. 

It got cold for a long while, but even with limited visibility, I just kept going until I got there, completely wiped out.
