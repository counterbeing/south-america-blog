They kept zipping by with all of the wind, and people would seek shelter, then run back out and fly more. </figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3726/11498843755_3ea6b1b17f_c.jpg" alt="Sunset"><figcaption>I took a photo of the sunset, but I wasn't happy with it. It didn't really say anything about what was happening. I stepped back a bit, and took this photo. This is the place where everyone sits and watches the paragliders. Also, where they seek shelter. And where some women sell beers, sodas, and snacks on the weekends.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3694/11498845305_a696fcef64_c.jpg" alt="Paragliding Take Off"><figcaption>This is where you take off.

He's my instructor for paragliding. His english isn't perfect, but neither is my spanish.

I'm psyched, and suddenly things are getting real. Don't worry, the helmet is not taped together.
