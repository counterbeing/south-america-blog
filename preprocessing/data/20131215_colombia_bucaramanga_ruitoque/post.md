## Sweet Flight, At Last

As long as I can remember I've wanted to fly. It's a recurring dream, in sleep, and in waking life. And I finally got to do it. 

### Meet Willie 

Claudia and Carlos were awesome enough to bring me to their favorite paragliding instructor. We showed up early, and didn't really know if Willie would be there. Eventually he came. Claudia told him I was investigating taking a course, and he immediately waved me over, and slapped me into a harness. Before we had spoken three sentences he had me with my hands on the controls, and was telling me to lean my body more into the turn.

No questions, no contracts, no liability waivers. There's something great about that. 

### Paragliding School

Things go pretty quick. I flew solo after just about five days of class, and felt pretty confident in doing so. Usually lessons would include some time working on ground handling, and some tandem flight time to practice take offs, turns, and landings. 

One day, Willie turned to me and asked how ready I felt on a scale of 1 to 10. I told  him about a five, thinking about how much work I wanted to do on ground handling. And he told me he thought I was closer to a 7. Flying, and ground handling are sort of two separate things, of course, you can get yourself into trouble with either in the wrong conditions.
