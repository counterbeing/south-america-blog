# A New Beginning
It had been about eight years since I had last been to Costa Rica. The last time I was in San Jose, someone had tried to mug me, so going back wasn't high on my priorities list, neither was sticking around for a while. 

I discovered a fantastic place to stay with a relaxed, down to earth, and welcoming group of people at [Hostel Bekuo](http://www.hostelbekuo.com). In any hostel you go to, the different people make a different dynamic, but there are some hostels that seem to attract a certain type of person, and this seems to be one of those places, and in a very good way. I really enjoyed my time here walking around San Jose, or staying in and cooking and talking with other folks. An easy life for a while. 

I also got the insider scoop on San Jose from my new friend Ericka. She was even good enough to introduce me to her friends, and take me on a weekend trip to Puerto Viejo. I had tons of fun, and my experience in San Jose would have been much shorter and less interesting without it.
