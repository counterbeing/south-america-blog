Huaraz has been a gas. Mostly due to my new Dutch buddies. I rode here from Huanchaco with the Dutchies in a car along side. The ride was mostly beautiful, and once again gave me an impressive cross section view of the geography of Peru. This time though, we landed in the true complete opposite of where we started. We went from hot beaches, to snow capped peaks, all in a day's ride. Incredible.
