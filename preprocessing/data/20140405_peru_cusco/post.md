I decided not to go to Machu Picchu. I know that sounds like a strange decision, but, I'm sick of ruins, and that made paying a couple hundred dollars to see some out of the question. If you're going to Cusco, and you're not going to Machu Picchu, and you're not going on long treks, I don't know that there's much left for you.

I was somewhat turned off by the megahostel scene, just trying to churn as many tourists through as possible. I was exhausted still from riding for two days when I woke up, but after a cup of coffee decided it was already time to get a move on, and so I did.
