## Technology and "Civilization"

This stop off was just a brief day trip. I needed to get a new power cord for my computer before mine failed. It was a marvelously twisty road through the mountains down into the vally. And when I arrived, I was at a mall, the likes of which I had not seen since leaving the states. It was very strage, and I fled as soon as I could.
