I wasn't entirely sure where to go after Lima. I actually wasn't ready to leave, but I also preferred moving on to finding a place in Lima with a free bed. So, I left. 

Huacachina is a funny tourist place. It's surrounded by desert sand dunes, but it's a small oasis with a pond. There are very few people here, at least right now, and the only attractions I know of are sandboarding, and riding around in dune buggies. So far, it's been a nice place to kick back and get a little work done. Maybe I'll climb a sand dune later.
