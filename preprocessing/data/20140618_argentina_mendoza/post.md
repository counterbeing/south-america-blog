The ride to get here was incredible. I initially had fears about the terrible weather that had passed through a few days earlier. But there was very little ice, and the snow was just on the sides of the road. Amazing what a couple of days of sunshine can do. 

Mendoza itself, seems really cute. I'd enjoy spending more time here, particularly to check out the wine scene, but right now I really just want to get a move on.
