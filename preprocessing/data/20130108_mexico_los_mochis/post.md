#Fear and Loathing in Los Mochis
I wound up in Los Mochis at around dusk. I was tired. I paid 350 pesos for a place to stay. It felt like a lot, though I know itâ€™s not that much. I felt utterly defeated. I ate some dinner. The bad feeling was still there. I began to wonder if this trip was really what I wanted to be doing. And did I want to be doing it alone? I walked back to the hotel and passed out before 9 PM
