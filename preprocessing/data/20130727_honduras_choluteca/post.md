## A Bland Evening

Not much to report here, and no pictures. I had a nice phone call from Whitney at this location, which was the turning point at which I decided I would try to fly back to San Francisco for Burning Man, or at least the seed was planted.

I stayed in a rather bland hotel, but the nice part was that they allowed me to wheel my motorcycle inside through the lobby. The borders on both sides of Honduras were no fun, but I made it just fine, and somehow avoided all of the police.
