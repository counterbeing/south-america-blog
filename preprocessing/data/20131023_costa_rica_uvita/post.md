### Jungle Paradise, Under Construction

I stayed at this fantastic little hostel called [Flutterby](http://flutterbyhouse.com). They had a really good thing going on. I didn't get the camera out much, more just kicked back and enjoyed. I stayed for maybe four days, and had a lovely time chatting it up with the people that lived there.

It's also worth noting that they're on some of the best beaches in Costa Rica (from what I've seen).
