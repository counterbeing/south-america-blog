I was surprised when I first arrived, mostly because I had no idea what a tourist town it was going to be. There are many hostels and hotels sprinkled everywhere. Despite this, it's still quite nice. There's lots of good food, it's affordable, and it's surrounded by loads of greenery.

Most of my time here was just spent doing some day hikes, finding curious things to eat, and generally wandering around to meet other travelers.
