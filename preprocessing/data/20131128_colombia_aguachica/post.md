### Small Town, Big Sound

There's not a lot going on here. It's hot during the day, not bad by night. Near where I stayed were countless dive bars, and small restaurants. It is worth noting that it's surrounded by some beautiful scenery, some plains and mountains. But on the whole, not much of a tourist destination.
I was certainly the only gringo that I came into contact with, which was kind of a nice change of pace.
