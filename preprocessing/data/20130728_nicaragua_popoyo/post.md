### A Quick Stop Off
I dashed in and out of here very quickly due to my visa restrictions. With just a few days left, I didn't want to risk a fine if something went wrong and kept me longer than intended. 

I had a beautiful pacific ocean view, a $6 room that smelled unmistakibly of air freshener and urine, and no good place to work. I wished I could stay a bit longer, but not much.
