# Peace and Quiet and Italians
Playa Nosara  was one of the most delightful places I've stayed. It's fairly remote, with a fair bit of dirt road required to get there. But on the other hand, it has it's more gringofied neighboring towns. I didn't actually stay in Nosara, I was in a smaller town called Playa Garza. 

I stayed in [a hotel in playa garza](http://sunandwaveshotel.com/), but because it was low season, they rented me an apartment longer term. So, I stayed for a month. It was a fantastic, small little room, but it had two beds in it, and a little kitchen. It really had everything I needed, and I was quite content there. There was almost nobody around. The occasional guests would come through. Some people would come to the restaurant for dinner, or some nights they just wouldn't, and that was great for me too.

We'd rig up the projector and put a movie on many evenings. Some days, I would get to go surfing at a nearby beach. Life was pretty good. Towards the end I got a slight bit of the ol' cabin fever, but up to that point, it was lovely for me.
