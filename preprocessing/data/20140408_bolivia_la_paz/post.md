It looks as if there are a number of lovely things to do here in La Paz. First off, I'm knocking some work out. 

Already I'm noticing some differences from Peru. It's definitely much less oriented towards toursim. They really didn't go out of their way to make migration very easy or cheap. In Peru, as I recall, it was free. I arrived at the border and they told me that in order to enter their country I had to pay $135 USD. I was flabberghasted. It seemed to me that a country that didn't have a bunch of cash would want to encourage tourism... but, no. I paid the $135 reluctantly, not being sure if I was being had by some corrupt official. But, I did some research when I reached La Paz, and it turns out they [single out Americans](http://www.southamericaliving.com/living-in-bolivia-visas-fees/) to pay a bunch of money at the border. If I were Canadian, I could enter for free. Stranger still, they wanted it in USD.

The city looks rather pretty in some parts. I'm excited to explore more.
