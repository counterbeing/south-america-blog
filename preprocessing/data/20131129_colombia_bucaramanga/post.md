# A City, and a Place Away

## A familiar face...

I met a great guy by the name of Edgar while in Costa Rica. He told me to stop in when I arrived in Colombia, and he really meant it. Immediately he suggested I should stay for New Years (over a month away).

## Flying

Edgar has a few buddies that are into Paragliding. I managed to get up in a paraglider for a few minutes with a buddy of his... And am now contemplating taking some lessons.
