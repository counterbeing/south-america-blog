My new suit arrived just in time for an on-time departure. And I struggled to wrap things up with work.</p>\n<p>It’s too bad I couldn’t have planned the weather out better. It was a little bit lousy on the whole. There were a few places heading south, where the storm was to the east, and I got a gap in the clouds that allowed me to be in the sun and look at the ocean. Then every now and again I would get a slight coating and then completely rained on.</p>\n<p>It seems that my heated grips work almost too well. It felt like I was holding a hot cup of coffee that was just on the verge of too hot for hours. I could let go for a second and let my hands cool off, but the heat felt like it was warming up the rest of my body. My hands feel slightly burnt. It was as if the combination of all of the rain and that consistant temperature did a sous vide job on my hands.</p>\n<p>I must have left at about 11:30 AM, and arrived around 10:30 PM. I know that seems like an awfully long time for a 500 mile ride, but I decided to start out on highway 1 in the spirit of adventure. Also, I could see where the rain was, and tried to steer around it. It paid off. All in all, such a ride was really taxing, but yesterday was one of the longest rides that I have planned out on my trip. Most of the other distances will be much shorter, and also much slower. No doubt there will be long and tiring days, but I feel that there’s something especially arduous about LA traffic in the rain.</p>\n<p>Now I get to relax for a few days in Orange County. It doesn’t feel very real. I’m comfortable, and with friends. And somehow the reality of this trip still isn’t setting in. I don’t know what it’s going to take.</p>\n",
