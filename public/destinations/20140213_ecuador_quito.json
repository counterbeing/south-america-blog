The people tend to be friendly, but they seem afraid of interaction on some levels (particularly when walking alone, I think they think I&#39;m going to rob them or something). </p>\n<p>I&#39;m still here while writing this, so I might just update it.</p>\n",

I see a lot of people with big guns here, but for some reason these guys seemed sort of intent. And since they walked past me i could take a photo without them noticing. I don't generally like to stick a camera in the face of people with guns. </figcaption></figure><figure><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7326/12506151455_a143465e54_c.jpg\" alt=\"Cute Street\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7411/12506632224_b51ff0c3fc_c.jpg\" alt=\"Big Church Quito\"><figcaption>I don't recall the name of it.
