I had heard that the longest left point break in the world was in Peru, but didn&#39;t know it went by the name Chicama until I was already on my way. I left most of my stuff in Huanchaco to keep things simple, and hit the road.</p>\n<p>It&#39;s a really funny small town. There&#39;s really not a lot to do there, unless you surf, in which case, there&#39;s tons to do. Time out of the water is generally spent eating to restore enough energy to get back into the water. The only people to visit were surfers, and likewise, it was only surfers at the <a href=\"http://www.lonelyplanet.com/peru/puerto-chicama/hotels/el-hombre\" title=\"this is the hostel where we stayed\">El Hombre Hostal</a> There was a swell on the way so, there were a bunch of people all getting excited and coming to park on the cliff and watch as though it could all change any second, and some of them just to bow down in appreciation of this glorious wave. </p>\n<p>I had a few nice surf sessions. It was a really great place to see some truly great surfers at work. Almost every wave had someone on it, and yet somehow there still seemed to be waves to go around. </p>\n<p>On the way out of town we decided to get a little lost and take some roads that we weren&#39;t entirely sure were there, and had some fun getting lost.</p>\n",
