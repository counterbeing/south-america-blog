      "body": "<p>Today started out with a walk to find some SOAT (motorcycle insurance). I discovered I could only buy it in year increments in San Ignacio, and that just would not do, because it was rather expensive. After departing San Ignacio late because I was trying to deal with insurance, I ended up at a road blocked for construction with a bunch of guys.</p>\n<p>It&#39;s a regular party whenever there&#39;s construction around here. Everyone gets out of there cars and buys snack from a few local vendors with a tarp structure set up to block the sun. I was told I would be sitting there baking for 20 minutes, so I got off the bike and had a chat. Everyone agreed that the only place to pick up insurance was Chiclayo. I decide then and there to change course. I wanted to get insurance so I didn&#39;t have to worry about police, I&#39;ve heard they can be a real pest. Additionally, I like to respect the laws of the country I&#39;m in... Except for the dumb ones, like speed limits of around 20  mph on open road with nobody around. And most important of all: I wanted some of this ceviche I&#39;ve been hearing about.</p>\n<p>The ride was stunning. Somehow running in that direction you cross the mountain range, and it results in a glorious cross section of Peruvian climates. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a geologist&#39;s wet dream.</p>\n<p>The whole time I was slightly concerned about running into police, without insurance I was asking for trouble. Most likely someone would want to be bribed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"peruvian-soat\">Peruvian SOAT</h3>\n<p>Getting my SOAT was no easy thing due to where I crossed in. I ended up having to go to Chiclayo to get it. I just wanted to share a bit on how that went.</p>\n<p>Part one is finding a place to sleep that can store a motorcycle. Here&#39;s one that treated me nicely and was pretty cheap. It&#39;s called Aurora&#39;s and there&#39;s a photo below: <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/6%C2%B045&#39;51.5%22S+79%C2%B050&#39;26.5%22W/@-6.76432,-79.8407,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x0 Aurora&#39;s Hostel\">map</a>.</p>\n<p>And here&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/6%C2%B046&#39;23.2%22S+79%C2%B050&#39;18.2%22W/@-6.77312,-79.8384,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x0\" title=\"SOAT Seller\">the place I got my SOAT</a> for 45 days. It took a few minutes, and cost about $50 USD which I thought was quite steep.</p>\n<h3 id=\"lessons-learned\">Lessons Learned</h3>\n<p>While in the shower a moment ago, I started thinking about some of the things that I&#39;ve learned on this trip, whilst stooping to pick a bar of dropped soap up.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Every time you use a bar of soap, it is a new bar of soap.</li>\n<li>Shampoo is way overrated... <a href=\"http://www.whitneyfreedman.com\" title=\"Thank you Whitney\">Some natural oil in your hair can be stylish</a>, and when it is dirty, you <em>can</em> wash your hair with a bar of soap.</li>\n<li>You can wash underwear in the sink, and with good conditions have them be dry in in the morning.</li>\n<li>Motorbiking everywhere gives you awesome street cred.</li>\n<li>A large rock could fall on you at any time, so live it up.</li>\n<li>The sun will always find the shortest path to your nose: put sunscreen on it.</li>\n<li>Police can smell fear, and detect body language, even through a motorcycle suit. You&#39;re not guilty, don&#39;t look guilty (even if you are a little guilty).</li>\n<li>The most important aspect to speaking a new language is confidence â€“ act like you know what you&#39;re talking about, and you probably do.</li>\n<li>Police have a life too... Playing dumb really can get you a long way, as long as you&#39;re willing to swallow your ego.</li>\n<li>When asking to take someone&#39;s photo, don&#39;t feel weird about it, or they&#39;ll feel weird about it.</li>\n</ul>\n",
