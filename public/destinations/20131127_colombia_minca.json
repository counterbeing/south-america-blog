So, I skipped out on Santa Marta, and headed for the hills.</p>\n<p>I didn&#39;t have much time here, but I was happy to see it. The highlight was walking up to Hostel Casa Loma and checking out their view for a little while with a beer. I didn&#39;t initally realize I couldn&#39;t ride my motorcycle there somehow, but they&#39;re way up a hill.</p>\n",
