It&#39;s not a super pretty city, at least not the side of it I saw. I wish I had gotten to spend some time checking out some of the salsa dancing while I was there. But one of the days I was there, was Sunday, and on Sunday there is nobody in town. Completely empty, walking around reminded me of the beginning of 28 days later. It felt deserted.</p>\n",
