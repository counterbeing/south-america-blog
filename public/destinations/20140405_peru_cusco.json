I know that sounds like a strange decision, but, I&#39;m sick of ruins, and that made paying a couple hundred dollars to see some out of the question. If you&#39;re going to Cusco, and you&#39;re not going to Machu Picchu, and you&#39;re not going on long treks, I don&#39;t know that there&#39;s much left for you.</p>\n<p>I was somewhat turned off by the megahostel scene, just trying to churn as many tourists through as possible. I was exhausted still from riding for two days when I woke up, but after a cup of coffee decided it was already time to get a move on, and so I did. </p>\n",
