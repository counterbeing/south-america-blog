He tried again immediately, and was immediately back on the ground. He paused. Not sure if he was just going to keep doing it, i went over, and surprisingly, he just let me pick him up. I held him there for about three minutes while he gathered his wits, and then he flew off, opting to go the opposite direction of the glass.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src=\"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3804/11981639606_6a7061d00c_c.jpg\" alt=\"Train\"><figcaption>An old steam train. An invention that revolutionized the valley. </figcaption></figure><figure><img src=\"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3791/11981114423_a2b86ce3c4_c.jpg\" alt=\"Light Pillars\"><figcaption>These light up at night.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src=\"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3729/11981643936_c74b65f71a_c.jpg\" alt=\"Looking Up\"><figcaption>I went on a great walking tour, which is where many of these photos are from. The tour guide said this was one of the best photos in Medellín. It was worth  chuckle, but it does make a cool photo. </figcaption></figure><figure><img src=\"https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2855/11981215524_a327389afa_c.jpg\" alt=\"Botero Roman Statue\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=\"https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2849/11981121113_5d068cf0fe_c.jpg\" alt=\"Botero Horse Statue\"><figcaption>These oddly proportioned status by Botero are all over town. </figcaption></figure><figure><img src=\"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3692/11981123043_c79475b032_c.jpg\" alt=\"Mural\"><figcaption>This mural extended on for ages detailing history of the city. </figcaption></figure><figure><img src=\"https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2823/11981220984_5cccd14ec0_c.jpg\" alt=\"Church Exterior\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=\"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3676/11981126463_81044e9f88_c.jpg\" alt=\"Church Interior\"><figcaption>A shot from the side where you can see  most of it. I kind of like this, even with the distortion of the panorama. </figcaption></figure><figure><img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5541/11981128073_ebac3abdcc_c.jpg\" alt=\"Church Interior\"><figcaption>There are so many massive churches.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src=\"https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2887/11981225514_96f047f2ea_c.jpg\" alt=\"Bird Bomb\"><figcaption>This statue was blown up in a public place about 20 years ago. A number of people were killed, but the status was left in place as a reminder.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7337/11981227284_3d3792e00f_c.jpg\" alt=\"Metro Station\"><figcaption>The metro station is clean. The metro itself is quiet and one of the nicest public transit systems I've ever seen. </figcaption></figure><figure><img src=\"https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2863/12077493316_bd0f563ff5_c.jpg\" alt=\"Lift\"><figcaption>Due to the hills here, they've actually included a sort of gondola to take people home. This station connects directly to the metro. It's fun in and of itself. </figcaption></figure><figure><img src=\"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3820/12077257064_3f37076f34_c.jpg\" alt=\"View from the Gondola\"><figcaption>Here's some of what we saw as we rode up. </figcaption></figure><figure><img src=\"https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2805/12159292153_b523984d29_c.jpg\" alt=\"Tejo\"><figcaption>Tejo is a funny Colombian game. I guess it's a bit like horseshoes. You throw a metal disc at this clay thing. You can barely make out the steel ring, but the two pink triangles are right on top of it at the edges. You try to get it in the middle. The pink papers are actually pouches filled with gunpowder that explode when it, making the game exponentially more fun. </figcaption></figure><figure><img src=\"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3743/12159295833_93e89cf1bf_c.jpg\" alt=\"Tejo\"><figcaption>Good form.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src=\"https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2839/12159299573_137d2caedb_c.jpg\" alt=\"The Tejo\"><figcaption>This is the disc.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src=\"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3716/12159467154_46d97aa3f6_c.jpg\" alt=\"Tejo\"><figcaption>This gives you a bit more of an idea of the place. You grab a beer, hang out and throw tejos around. </figcaption></figure><figure><img src=\"https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2882/12159470384_26611d71d4_c.jpg\" alt=\"Pasta Dinner\"><figcaption>We made a really nice chicken pesto pasta at the hostel. Everyone was happy. </figcaption></figure>"
