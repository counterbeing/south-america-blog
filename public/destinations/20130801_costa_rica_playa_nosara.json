It&#39;s fairly remote, with a fair bit of dirt road required to get there. But on the other hand, it has it&#39;s more gringofied neighboring towns. I didn&#39;t actually stay in Nosara, I was in a smaller town called Playa Garza. </p>\n<p>I stayed in <a href=\"http://sunandwaveshotel.com/\">a hotel in playa garza</a>, but because it was low season, they rented me an apartment longer term. So, I stayed for a month. It was a fantastic, small little room, but it had two beds in it, and a little kitchen. It really had everything I needed, and I was quite content there. There was almost nobody around. The occasional guests would come through. Some people would come to the restaurant for dinner, or some nights they just wouldn&#39;t, and that was great for me too.</p>\n<p>We&#39;d rig up the projector and put a movie on many evenings. Some days, I would get to go surfing at a nearby beach. Life was pretty good. Towards the end I got a slight bit of the ol&#39; cabin fever, but up to that point, it was lovely for me. </p>\n",
