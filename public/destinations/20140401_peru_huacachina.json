So, I left. </p>\n<p>Huacachina is a funny tourist place. It&#39;s surrounded by desert sand dunes, but it&#39;s a small oasis with a pond. There are very few people here, at least right now, and the only attractions I know of are sandboarding, and riding around in dune buggies. So far, it&#39;s been a nice place to kick back and get a little work done. Maybe I&#39;ll climb a sand dune later. </p>\n",
