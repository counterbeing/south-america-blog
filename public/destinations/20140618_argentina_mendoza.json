But there was very little ice, and the snow was just on the sides of the road. Amazing what a couple of days of sunshine can do. </p>\n<p>Mendoza itself, seems really cute. I&#39;d enjoy spending more time here, particularly to check out the wine scene, but right now I really just want to get a move on.</p>\n",
