Despite this, it&#39;s still quite nice. There&#39;s lots of good food, it&#39;s affordable, and it&#39;s surrounded by loads of greenery.</p>\n<p>Most of my time here was just spent doing some day hikes, finding curious things to eat, and generally wandering around to meet other travelers.</p>\n",

We heard a rumble and all ran over to the edge to see a giant plume of smoke slowly rising. I feel very lucky to have seen it.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7392/12615316385_6f5fd20e89_c.jpg\" alt=\"Tree Swing\"><figcaption>Proper tree swing, somehow it held together.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src=\"http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5523/12615327845_5c6fb30673_c.jpg\" alt=\"Handstand Battle\"><figcaption>We battled, I lost.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src=\"http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5527/12615447133_d620fdef7a_c.jpg\" alt=\"Chill Spot\"><figcaption>Some music, some beers, some soft grass, and a bit too much sun. All in all, a great day.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7391/12615755914_141e55f92d_c.jpg\" alt=\"New Friends\"><figcaption>We picked up Florian on the road (The German dude on the right). </figcaption></figure><figure><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7404/12615773694_7de5d5909a_c.jpg\" alt=\"Tomates de Arbol\"><figcaption>These are the tree tomatoes growing on the side of the hill. In general they're pureed and put in juice with a bit of sugar. They taste a bit like tomatoes but much more sour, and a touch earthy. It really does make for some fantastic juice.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7341/12615781834_569dbc0ebe_c.jpg\" alt=\"Baños Valley\"><figcaption>This is the town from up on the hill.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src=\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3739/12615391395_2a5fb8c085_c.jpg\" alt=\"Salt Water Toffee\"><figcaption>A bunch of guys pull toffee all day. It tastes exactly how you would expect it to.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7314/12615399515_c850bb04dc_c.jpg\" alt=\"Cuy Guinea Pig\"><figcaption>Here's some cuy, which is just grilled guinea pig. I wanted some, but wasn't hungry when we passed by. We came back later to get a plate, but they were closed. The woman in the background is somewhat unamused, though I did ask about taking photos before going to town.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src=\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3821/12615411555_003dd05591_c.jpg\" alt=\"Cuy\"><figcaption>You can see his little teeth in this one. </figcaption></figure><figure><img src=\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3768/12615822674_3fcc2bcba2_c.jpg\" alt=\"Evelyn\"><figcaption>I went out for beers with a couple of buddies, and suddenly evelyn disappeared into a piercing shop...</figcaption></figure><figure><img src=\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3773/12615538813_1646ef2699_c.jpg\" alt=\"Church\"><figcaption>Yet another church, this one had great carvings on the door.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src=\"http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2838/12615846354_20a3b5d66e_c.jpg\" alt=\"Church Carvings\"><figcaption>You can't see all of the carvings, but they're quite impressive.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src=\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3818/12615852884_d0318867af_c.jpg\" alt=\"Sugar Cane\"><figcaption>This is something I've seen over and over in latin america, and confuses me to no end. Each of those blue booths is selling the same sugar cane, for the same price, in the same booth... </figcaption></figure><figure><img src=\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3733/12615868524_fcd4203573_c.jpg\" alt=\"Chifles\"><figcaption>You've got your roasted corn, something like a soybean, fried plantain chips, salsa, and a cocktail sauce. Quite good, and probably the healthiest street food I've ever had.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src=\"http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5511/12615586573_0d3374b90a_c.jpg\" alt=\"Chifles Vendor\"><figcaption>I had seen this around and wanted to try it, so I walked over to where a police officer was getting her chifles, and asked her what they were. She told me, and then she offered me a bite with her own spoon. I thought it a bit odd because in the states I feel like police try to separate themselves to keep a sense of authority. But no, she gave me a spoonful of chifles, I promply bought my own, it was quite good.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7433/12615493575_7c03f3b3a8_c.jpg\" alt=\"Waterfall\"><figcaption>This waterfall feeds the hot springs cold water.
