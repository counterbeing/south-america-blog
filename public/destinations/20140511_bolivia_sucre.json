All this due to about a hundred miles of cobblestone and dirt. It was apparant that some work needed to be done on the bike before moving on. </p>\n<p>Fortunately, someone recommended a really nice hostel with some friendly folks that let me park in the courtyard and work on the bike. Took a good bit of time to hack off a couple of bolts to get the box off. The two remaining bolts were so bent that I couldn&#39;t remove them as intended. I had to take parts off of the bike to bring them to a welder to get them extracted. Then it was only about five more stops to get all of the necessary parts. I have to say, I&#39;m pleased with the results, but it was a reail pain to get it done.  </p>\n",
