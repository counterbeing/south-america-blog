But the thing that&#39;s most beautiful is the wildlife in the ocean.</p>\n<p>There are some downsides to living on land too. You&#39;re pretty much fish in a bucket for people who want to sell you things, and that can get pretty annoying. The english here, isn&#39;t exactly english. I thought that being in Belize, it would be relatively easy to communicate with the locals, but no. It&#39;s perhaps harder than in a second language, because here, you both purport to be speaking the same language to begin with.</p>\n<p>Anyway, Matt and I got some diving done while we were here, and it was lovely.</p>\n",
