Near where I stayed were countless dive bars, and small restaurants. It is worth noting that it&#39;s surrounded by some beautiful scenery, some plains and mountains. But on the whole, not much of a tourist destination.\nI was certainly the only gringo that I came into contact with, which was kind of a nice change of pace.</p>\n",
