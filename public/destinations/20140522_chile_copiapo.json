I can&#39;t say I&#39;m terribly surprised, it was a perfect storm of a rich carb, high altitudes, and shitty gasoline that I think did me in. Somehow though, I landed in a good place, and with friendly people that were willing to help me.</p>\n<p>My time here hasn&#39;t been terribly interesting. The food in general, isn&#39;t terriffic, and is expensive. I spend a lot of my time at my hotel, reading or trying to get work done.</p>\n<p>So, after pulling the head off, it appears I burnt a valve. I&#39;m not sure what the total bill is yet, but we&#39;ll start at about $300 in parts.</p>\n",
