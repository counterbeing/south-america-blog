Went to bed early, got up early, had breakafast and got out. It felt like a pretty standard small town. It had a church, and a square, and everything you&#39;d expect, and nothing more.</p>\n",

For some reason, many places don't see the need of toilet seats, and they also think it better to flush with bucket water than plumbing water into the toilet.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src=\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3711/13664700295_9e4c3df2a1_c.jpg\" alt=\"Chicken Feet Soup\"><figcaption>It's always seemed odd to me, but there are often chicken feet in the soup. The soup is great, but I just can't bring myself to chew chicken feet. I can't help but think of them standing around in their own...</figcaption></figure>"
