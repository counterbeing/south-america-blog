I didn't manage to get a photo of a super gory Jesus because there were a bunch of people that looked really sad around him... But this Jesus was alone, and down for a photo shoot.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7375/12822485543_7023b912a0_c.jpg\" alt=\"Scary People\"><figcaption>This kind of creeped me out.</figcaption></figure>"
