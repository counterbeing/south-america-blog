I really did often take three showers a day there, it was just hard to cope without them. The old town is pleasant, but I enjoyed where I was staying a little bit more. Things were a bit dirtier and cheaper, which is how I like them.</p>\n<p>The other bikers from be boat were around for a few days, so there was some hanging out with them. Right after getting the bikes off of the boat with the other folks, I got to ride Billy&#39;s BMW GS, it was quite a treat, perhaps not the bike for me, but interesting just the same. He pointed out that my brakes were a bit mushy, and after riding his bike with power breaks, I knew he was right.</p>\n<p>So, it was, new grips, bleed the brakes oil change. I found the oil easily, as with the grips, just took some walking around. Unfortunately, I overestimated the abilities of a local mechanic yet again. I just didn&#39;t want to actually deal with brake fluid without the proper tools and disposal, so I let someone else do it. The job was botched fairly quickly, brake fluid was carelessly allowed to run out on the ground,  and before they tried to pull the master cylinder apart, I told them to stop. I rode back to the hostel with no front brakes, and sorted it the next day. </p>\n",
