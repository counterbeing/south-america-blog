I found <a href=\"http://www.hostalelarbol.com/\">a nice hostel</a> to hang out at. Ate dinner, had a nap. Just when I thought nothing excitng was going to happen, which was perfect for a tired man, Jorge came and picked me up.</p>\n<p>Jorge is a guy I met on the internet, because he had been considering buying my motorcycle. Anyway, Jorge showed me a great time. I went to meet his family, and then went out to a birthday thing of one of his friends. I ended up out later than I wanted to be, but I didn&#39;t regret it.  </p>\n",
