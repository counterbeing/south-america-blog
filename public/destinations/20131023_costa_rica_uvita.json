They had a really good thing going on. I didn&#39;t get the camera out much, more just kicked back and enjoyed. I stayed for maybe four days, and had a lovely time chatting it up with the people that lived there.</p>\n<p>It&#39;s also worth noting that they&#39;re on some of the best beaches in Costa Rica (from what I&#39;ve seen).</p>\n",
